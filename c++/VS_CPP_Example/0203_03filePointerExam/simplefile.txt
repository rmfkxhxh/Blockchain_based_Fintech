Closing a File
When a C++ program terminates it automatically flushes all the streams, release all the allocated memory and close all the opened files.
But it is always a good practice that a programmer should close all the opened files before program termination.
Following is the standard syntax for close() function, which is a member of fstream, ifstream, and ofstream objects.
